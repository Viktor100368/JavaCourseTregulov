Had I the heavens embroidered cloths,
Enwrought wiith golden and silver light,
The blue and the dim of the dark cloths
Of night and light and the half-light,
I would spread the cloths under your feet:
But I being goor have only my dreams;
I have spread my dreams under your feet;
Tread sortly, becarse you tread on my dreams
				William Batler Yeats
